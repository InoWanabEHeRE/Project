SavvyData’s hard- and smart-working team members make a point of communicating early and often, at the start of an engagement and regularly throughout the development lifecycle. We endeavor to quantify known risk areas in advance — not because we are risk averse, but because we are realists who prefer to be prepared. Because information loses value over time, we insist on providing frequent status updates.
